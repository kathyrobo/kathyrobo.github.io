            i like to go to the movies alone.get alone and alone.weatherstaying with my friend or entertain yourself,i enjoy it all.After finishing elementary school,i went back to shenzhen to attend a american international school.there are all kind of people there.some people reky money for det in.there are also serious learner.Like a small society.i was bording there.i learned more skills with dilling with people.When i started the secound year,i went to UK to go to school,i was the only chinese student in my year,prehaps this is the reason my english is improving really quikily.I am really friendly so I have a lot of friend in that school.what impressed me the most was how the teacher taught there,Compered with the domestic,there are really few homework and they will mot put a lot presure on you.Getting alone with them is more like making friend.Every lesson is fun and happy.Because of the virus,the school close and I return to my contry for staying a few month.the school will start to open again at 1/9,I am really missing my friend and looking foreard to see them again.
